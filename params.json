Although there are many great libs with the same purpose, I find them too cumbersome for the kind of apps I'm constantly working on.\r\n\r\n**THIS IS NOT A FULL JSON-TO-OBJECT MAPPER**. If you're looking for a full featured mapper i suggest you take a look at Jackson or Gson. Use simple json mapper if you're working with simple or small pieces of json data  that you have control over (Almost all the json APIs I use are created by me).\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\nLet's say we have a `Product` class that looks like this:\r\n\r\n \tpublic class Product {\r\n\t\r\n\t\tprivate String name;\r\n\t\tprivate int amount;\r\n\t\tprivate double price;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nAnd our json looks like this:\r\n\r\n\t{\"name\": \"potato\", \"amount\": 10, \"price\": 2.5}\r\n\r\nTo map our json the a `Product` object we can simply:\r\n\r\n\tObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n\tProduct product = objectMapper.readValue(jsonString, Product.class);\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
